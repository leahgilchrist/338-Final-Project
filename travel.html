    <p class="grid_8"> <span class="large"> #1 Greece:</span> Price Range: $$$. If you are looking to splurge on a dream vacation this summer, then Greece could be your place. The picturesque white buildings, and beatiful beaches make these islands worth the money! If you are going to make the trek all the way to Greece you must check out multiple islands. The easiest way to get from island to island is by the ferries. I recommend going to Santorini, Mykonos, and Athens, and you can add in day trips to the smaller islands in between! Some popular activities on the islands include: renting atvs, going on catamaran boats, going to different beaches, and visiting the local attractions. Be prepared to eat lots of gyros and tzatiki sauce!! </p>

    <p class="grid_8"> <span class="large"> #2 Costa Rica:</span> Price Range: $$. A tropical paradise without breaking the bank! Costa Rica is a beautiful place eo enjoy surfing, hiking, and many adventurous activities! When I traveled to Costa Rica with my family we did white water rafting, ziplining, and atving. I recommend doing some outdoor adventurous activities while you are there, because the scenery around you is beautiful. If that isn't your thing, there are many scenic beaches were you can relax and sip on a cool drink. This vacation can really cater to anybody! Immerse yourself in the language and culture while you are there, because although it looks similar to Hawaii, you will meet many more locals. I hope you get a chance to visit this awesome place this summer! PURA VIDA!</p>

    <p class="grid_8"> <span class="large"> #3 Road Trip:</span> Price Range: $. Short on cash but still want to have a great summer? Grab your best friends and hit the road!! Especially if you live in California, there are so many places to visit that are just short drives away. Start on the coast and go up or down from there! Some highlights include: shopping in San Fran, camping in Big Sur, eating in Santa Barbara, and going to the beach in San Diego. As long as you have good company, good music, and good snacks, you really don't need a plan! Just enjoy the ride :)</p>
