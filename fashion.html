    <p class="article_text grid_8"> <span class="large"> #1 Sunglasses </span> Bigger is better right? When it comes to sunglasses and summer the answer is a YES! This summer your go to accessory needs to be an oversized pair of sunglasses. I love mixing and matching sunglasses based on my mood. Whether I want to be trendy, girly, or edgy, I can find the perfect pair of glasses! Not to mention they are a must when I am at the beach all the time. Some of my favorite places to find sunglasses are Urban Outfitters, Target, and Kate Spade. I recommend having a few pairs of sunglasses and keeping them in different places, so you always have some on hand! Also, I usually try buying a cheaper pair for places like the beach, or hiking and then a nicer pair for when I am dressed up.</p>

    <p class="article_text grid_8"> <span class="large"> #2 Overalls </span> OVERALL, we can tell it's going to be a great summer. Especially when we look good and feel comfortable! I am so happy that overalls are back in stores and cuter than ever. This is such an easy outfit option for a hot summer day. A great way to add variation is by pairing the overalls with different shirts underneath. Crop tops, or patterned ringer tees are great options to wear underneath. Pair with a crop top and converse for a casual look, or dress them up with a  flowy off the shoulder top and wedges. I love how versatile they can be!  </p>

     <p class="article_text grid_8"> <span class="large"> #3 One Pieces</span> Who says modest isn't hottest? One pieces are making the biggest comeback! There are so many leading swim suit companies who are coming out with the cutest styles for one pieces. With cutouts, patterns, crochet and many other intricate details, there are many opportunities for cute styles. They are taking advantage of the added material to make the suits even cuter! Not to mention a perfect solution for when you don't feel bikini bod ready. Make sure you find your pefect one piece this summer, you won't regret it!  </p>
