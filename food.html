    <p class="grid_8"> <span class="large"> #1 Avocados </span>The good kind of fat! Avocados are my favorite addition to any meal. Seriously they can go with anything!! Restaraunts have been getting extremely fancy with there avocado toast pairings, but my favorite way is simply just mashed avocado with salt, pepper, and garlic salt. It is the perfect and filling breakfast, or makes a great snack. Other ideas can be to add tomatoes, feta cheese, balsamic, or really anything that you feel like! The options are endless so you will never get bored with this easy snack. Just make sure your avocado is ripe before cutting, because nothing is sadder than a hard avocado ☹</p>

    <p class="grid_8"> <span class="large"> #2 Strawberries </span>Summer never tasted so SWEET! My recent summer obsession is snacking on strawberries all day every day. I always buy organic ones, and they are perfect!! Strawberries aren't in season all year round, so make sure that you take advantage of them while they are in their prime taste. Strawberries make a great addition to breakfast, but also can be used in fruit salads, to top on acai bowls, add in smoothies, or even put in a spinach salad!! You can find a link to my favorite strawberry salad recipe here:

Whatever you choose to do with this cute fruit, make sure you add them to your weekly grocery list this summer!

    <p class="grid_8"><span class="large"> #3 Bell Peppers </span> Versatility is key, and you can use bell peppers in almost every meal this summer! After reading this post I hope you will go straight to the store and buy a pack of bell peppers. These are the perfect addition to every single meal- seriously add them to your breakfast, lunch, and dinner!! Not only do they have a sweet taste, but they are also really good for you too. Bell peppers are a great addition to omelets and scrambles, they add that extra sweetness and crunch! You should also put them in salads for lunch, or even dip them in ranch or hummus as a healthy low carb snack. For dinner, they are a great addition to Asian stir frys, and a must have for fajitas. The list can go on about other ways to use bell pepper, but I challenge you to think of some new fun ways, and then share them with me!!
